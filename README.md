## Assignment Contents
This assignment includes solutions and explanations for exercises and problems from **Chapters 1, 2, and 3**, covering topics such as:

### 1. Sorting and Efficiency
   - **Real-World Sorting Examples**: Descriptions of practical scenarios where sorting is necessary.
   - **Shortest Distance Calculation**: Examples using algorithms to determine shortest paths.
   - **Efficiency Beyond Speed**: Analysis of other efficiency metrics like memory usage, scalability, and energy consumption.

### 2. Data Structures
   - **In-Depth Study of Hash Tables**: Examination of the strengths and limitations of hash tables, including their average-case and worst-case performance.
   - **Practical Use Cases**: Scenarios where hash tables are ideal and where alternative data structures may be preferred.

### 3. Algorithm Comparisons
   - **Shortest-Path vs. Traveling-Salesperson Problems**: Discussion of similarities and differences, with use cases for each.
   - **Best vs. Approximate Solutions**: Real-world examples illustrating when an optimal solution is necessary versus when an approximate solution is sufficient.

### 4. Algorithm Implementation and Analysis
   - **Insertion Sort and Merge Sort**: Step-by-step examples and analysis of running times.
   - **Binary Search**: Pseudocode and performance analysis, particularly when used within other sorting algorithms.
   - **Other Topics**: Additional algorithmic problems, such as recursive sorting, inversions, and efficiency optimizations in algorithm design.
